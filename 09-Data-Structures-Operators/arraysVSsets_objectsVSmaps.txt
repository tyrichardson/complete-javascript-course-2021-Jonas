Sources of Data:
1. From the program (written in the source code)
2. From the UI (user input or data written in the DOM)
3. From external source (an API from database, website... and endpoint)
 
A Collection of Data to be stored:
  Need a Data Structure:
    - A Simple List? (use Arrays or Sets)
    - Key/Value pairs? (Objects or Maps)

      Keys describe the values ("the data they contain")

      In web development, most data comes from an API in JSON format
      
      A JSON file is an object (of objects) that you assign to a variable when it is received; many of the values are Arrays

Use Arrays when:
  - data must be ordered
  - you want duplicates, if they exist
  - you want to manipulate data

Use Sets when:
  - order and retrieval are not important
  - you want zero duplicates
  - you want to remove duplicates from an array
  - high-performance is VERY important

Use Objects for :
  - Ability to write methods
  - Using "this"
  - Working with JSON files
  - Ease of writing them
  - Ease of recognizing them (familiar, traditional form)
  - Ease of retrieval using dot (.) and ['keyName'] (bracket) notation

Use Maps for:
 - Simply storing key/value pairs
 - Keys that are not strings
 - Need better performance
 - Ease of iteration
 - Ease of computing the size
